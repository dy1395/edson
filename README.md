This is the code repository for the Shiny App used as the submission for the Posit Table Contest 2024: https://forum.posit.co/t/world-cup-2022-recap-table-contest/188070.

A team of Princeton University students (Riley O'Hare, Lauren Pak, Vincent Etherton, Luis Guaman, Sena Cetin, and Jorge Hernandez) and their faculty leader (Day Yi) set forth to work on a data science project (aptly named Project Edson after the first name of soccer great Pele) related to the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026. As a prelude to this project, this team created this Shiny App to enter in the contest.

The premise of this table was to list all the games from the 2022 World Cup and to have the ability to drill down into each game at the user's discretion. Videos for each goal (courtesy of FOX Sports) can be viewed.

Some filters were also added to reduce the table output by Group and Team.

Please address any issues with the app to Day Yi (day.yi@princeton.edu).
